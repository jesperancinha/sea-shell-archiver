# sea-shell-rest-service

This module exemplifies three techniques to retrieve the data using mutable objects.

The three techniques used are:

1.  traditional MVC approach
2.  mutable solution with loose running subscribers
3.  wrapping a blocking call
4.  awaiting for the loose subscribers
5.  wrapping futures and fork-joins
6.  one by one alternative
7.  mutable solution with coordinated publishers
8.  immutable solution with coordinated publishers

NOTE: In version [2.0.0](../ReviewLogs.md) of this project, there is a [new module](../sea-shell-service-immutable), where the immutable implementation is presented in one go.
Please have a look at it to see an example of a better implementation.
