Following the upgrade to Spring 3.0.0 I realized that it is almost impossible to keep the SOAP example of today.

SOAP is beyond obsolete and this upgrade sure lets me know of that. There is no more "zo mooi", "so beautiful", "tao
bonita", way of keeping SOAP.

As technologies advance we are probably witnessing the last traces of SOAP usage, which means that even for this
example, the application of a reactive framework applied to legacy services, a SOAP example will not work.

Given all of the above, I will upgrade the wiremock framework and individual mock SOAP services to a JSON based REST
services framework.
